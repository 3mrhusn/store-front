### Used Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) This is a cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used in running JavaScript codes on the server. It allows for installation and managing of dependencies and communication with databases.

- [ExpressJS](https://www.expresjs.org/) This is a NodeJS web application framework.

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Dockerâ€™s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.
